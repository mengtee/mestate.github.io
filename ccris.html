                <h2 class="heading2">Why CCRIS is important.</h2>
                <div class="line"></div>
                <p>CCRIS is  important because it measure your financial creditbility and Banks and financial institutions
                     assess loan applications differently but in generally, they wanted look for an evidence that show your 
                    steady repayment schedule, minimal defaults, and never missed payment.
                    <br>
                    In short, if your CCRIS is perfect, the bank will more likely to approve your loan and you are one step closer to 
                    your new housing.
