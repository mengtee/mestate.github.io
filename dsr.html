            <div class="line"></div>
            <p> DSR essentially is taking account of your loan and credit commitment that compare to your monthly income.
                By using DSR calculation, the banker will be able to see just how much of your income is being utilised to pay off debt and if
                 you can reasonably add on a new loan with respect to your earnings.
            </p>
            <p>Although the banks have their own algorithms in determining wheather to give a house loan to a buyer, however, 
                DSR is the main consideration before any other step ahead. 
                It is very important to make sure your DSR rate is not burst as to secure a housing loan from a bank.

                    <div class="col marginbottom" >
                        <p>By taking your nett income after EPF and Socso, you can times with the percentage given in the formula.
                            The amount after multiply the percentage given will be the total monthly committment you are allow from the 
                            bank perspective. 
                        </p>
                        <p>By giving out example, your monthly income is RM 5k, then 5000*70% equal to RM3500 of the total allowed committment.
                            Let say you have a total committment that monthly cost you RM2000, purchasing a house that have a monthly installment
                            less than RM1500 will allow you to get a housing loan from then bank. However, anything exceed RM1500 will considered
                            as DSR burst and will get rejected by the bank loan.

                <p class="marginbottom">For sure DSR is the main reason for the bank to allow a housing loan, however, other factors also will 
                    affect your chances in getting a housing loan.
                    The most important record is loan repayment record, always remember to repay your loan amount every monthly
                    especially for <strong>housing and car loan</strong>. If fail to do so, you may face a hard time in getting
                    a new loan from the bank.
